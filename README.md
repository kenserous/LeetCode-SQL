# LeetCode-SQL

This repository contains my solutions to the **SQL 50 Challenge** on LeetCode.
Currently a work in progress (10/50 problems completed). This repository will be updated weekly.

The SQL 50 Challenge focuses on:
1. Query Optimisation
2. Window Functions
3. CTEs and Joins

## Website
The website created documents all the solutions for each problem in the SQL 50 Challenge.
The website is created using the template **Hyperspace from HTML5UP** (https://html5up.net/).
The template is free to use under the CCA 3.0 license (https://html5up.net/license).

## Solutions Directory
Problems in the SQL 50 are categorised based on their difficulty: **easy, medium and hard.**
There will be folders for each difficulty. Each folder contains **.sql files** that refers to the solution for a particular problem.
Thought process and documentation is mostly explored in the website.
