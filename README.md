# LeetCode-SQL

This repository contains my solutions to the **SQL 50 Challenge** on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/). <br>
**Currently a work in progress** (10/50 problems completed). This repository will be updated weekly.

The **SQL 50 Challenge** focuses on:
1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
2. Basic and Advanced Joins
3. Aggregate Functions
4. Sorting and Grouping
5. Subqueries
6. Advanced String Functions, including Regex and Clauses

## Website
The website created documents the thought process and solutions for each problem in the SQL 50 Challenge. Still a work in progress. <br>
The website is created using the template **Hyperspace from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/)**. <br>
The template is free to use under the **[CCA 3.0 license](https://html5up.net/license)**.

## Solutions Directory
Problems in the SQL 50 are categorised based on their difficulty: **easy, medium and hard.** <br>
There will be folders for each difficulty. Each folder contains **.sql files** that refers to the solution for a particular problem. <br>
Thought process and documentation is mostly explored in the website.
